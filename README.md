# README

This is my first rails project! I am creating this project to build a website for my computer repair business in Victoria, BC. You can find the site by following this link: [Computer Repair Victoria](http://computerrepairnerds.com)

My knowledge of Rails isn't overly high, but I am currently experimenting and finding it to be rather awesome.

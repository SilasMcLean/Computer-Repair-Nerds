# README v2

Progeess: Instructions at this moment are still unavailable because we're only nearly part way through the development of the software we need for our client at Computer Repair Nerds in Victoria BC but we've decided to update this readme file for anyone interested in this unique software we're developing. Check out below for some details on the goals of this amazing software which is, as we can now safely say, halfway done after years of development!

Expected completion date: Somwhere in 2020. Yeah, we still have that much work to do.

Project goal and expectations: The software we're making for our client, an amazing [computer repair victoria](http://www.computerrepairnerds.com/) company, is truly one of a kind because we're allowing brand new visitors to be treated like signed in, longterm vistors by isntantly enabling them to all the features. All they have to do to sign in and start a new account is literaly click on a button. Our software works through a new un-named internet-item that is similar to a "cookie" but activates instantly and no where on the internet has anything like this been seen before. We're super excited because this software could end up being a revolution in the coding and website development process that could change the internet forever. So far it is only possible in Canada and America where the law permits such instant information-taking behavior. No where near are we yet ready to tell much more because we worry others will steal our idea but so far we're at least ready to share what we have just shared with you.

A sincere thank thank you and respect: For anyone who is lucky enoug to get involved in this poject, we thank you for your support and highly appreciate your interest.
